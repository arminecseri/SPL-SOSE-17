# SPL-SOSE-17
Student project for one of our universtiy courses

This is a repository for a student project at the Humboldt University of Berlin for the class "Statistical Programming Languages".The goal of the course was to give an introduction to students using the Programming Language "R". Our project will be investigating house prices in two states of the U.S. , Vermont and New Hampshire. The dataset was originally uploaded to the website "Kaggle.com". In our project we will try to find connections between the price of a house, and the attributes of the house (year the house was built in, size, number of rooms etc.). In this repository we will upload our full source code, and our report as well.
